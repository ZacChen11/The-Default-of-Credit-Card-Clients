The final report of the proejct.

exeperiment.py
The exeperiment to make comparisons between different classifiers and normalizers.
And the comparison between different data set using same classifier and normalizer.

execution_Log
An execution log file. It records the maximum precision in each execution time and the normalization(standardization)
methods respectively. To help finding the techniques that have better average performance.

Preprocessing.py
The class to preprocess the data.

Postprocessing.py
The class to postprocess the data.

plot_svm.py
Plot the classification visualization result(six features will be shown in three 2-D figures with 2 features each)

application.py
Prediction application in the project. Select the appropriate features and make prediction of default or non-default on
credit card.
